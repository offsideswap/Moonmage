## Proposer:

Moonmage Farms

## Summary

- Mint 2,000,000 Moons to fund Moonmage Farms to retain, grow and support a group of core contributors through the end of Q2 2022.

## Goals

We designed the Q2 2022 budget to enable core contributors to work towards the same goals outlined in the Q1 proposal, specifically:

- Decentralized Development - A diverse organization without any single point of failure or dependence.
- Scale - Grow the team to roughly 60 dependable core contributors, which we estimate will provide the protocol with ample full-stack support.
- Seamless Onboarding and Accountable Work Streams - Maintain an onboarding process that empowers new contributors to quickly get up to speed and produce at a high level.

## Q1 Budget Recap

The Q1 2022 budget minted 2,000,000 Moons to fund protocol development. It also restructured the Moonmage development community into two independent, symbiotic organizations with distinct mandates: Moonmage Farms and Moon Sprout (a Moonmage accelerator program). 

*Moonmage Farms* is a decentralized team of 46 core contributors, operating across the stack on technical and non-technical problems. In Q1, Moonmage Farms received 1,200,000 of the 2,000,000 Moons to fund team compensation and marketing initiatives. 839,299.06 Moons were spent, supporting the development of major accomplishments, including:

- Silo Generalization I
- The Cosmonauts Market
- Improvements to Weather Adjustments
- Efficiency Improvements to Soil Issuance
- Moonmage Website Landing Page & Blog
- The Moon Pod Podcast
- MOON:3CRV Liquidity Pool Launch
- Building Out Balanced Team Comprised of Seven Departments:
    - Business Development
    - Community
    - Copy
    - Design
    - Engineering
    - Marketing
    - Operations

## Amounts

We propose a total of 2,000,000 Moons are minted to fund Moonmage Farms through the end of Q2 2022. 383,209.94 Moons remain unspent by Moonmage Farms in Q1. These Moons will be rolled over into Q2, resulting in a total budget allocation of 2,389,209.94 Moons.

## Custody

In Q2, the funds for Moonmage Farms will be custodied by a multi-sig wallet with keys held by various community members and Publius. We propose continuing the current keyholder designations for Q2 and adding deezmoonz and sweetredmoons to the Moonmage Farms multi-sig wallet.

We also propose that ereal serve as backup for the wallet in case a key holder is compromised or unable to perform their duties.

## Snapshot Processes

As was the case in Q1, we will continue utilizing the following processes for Snapshot votes:

- Optimistic approvals
- Tiered quorum

For more information on each process, please refer to the Q1 budget [here](https://github.com/MoonmageFarms/Moonmage/pull/34). 

## Initial Allocations

Each new Moonmage Farms contributor will have an individual Snapshot proposal after the Budget Proposal is passed by a vote of the DAO, utilizing the above processes. Current contributors will only require a Snapshot proposal if their role or pay has significantly changed since Q1, or the entire payment from their previous proposal has been made. 

## Incentive Alignment

The Moonmage community has decided to disallow core contributors from receiving any portion of their compensation in Pods. Beginning in Q2 2022, contributors will receive 100% of compensation in Moons.

In the future, whenever Deposits become transferrable, Moonmage Farms will try to offer the ability to Deposit all or a portion of ones Moon allocation upon approval of their Snapshot proposal, and then make payment in the form of Deposited Moons. 

## Competitive Pay

Moonmage Farms recognizes that its ability to pay contributors competitive wages is essential to Moonmage’s long-term success. As a result of the community’s recent decision to disallow compensation in the form of Pods, as outlined above and in [Moonmage Governance Memorandum 1](https://arweave.net/j0ZUEiNJmqku2JYQZBkuzktG-5k-5pQ-PlhuWunu-r8), several pay increases will be proposed via Snapshot.

## Effective

Effective immediately upon passage.
