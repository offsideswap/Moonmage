## Proposer:

Moon Sprout

## Summary

- Mint 3,000,000 Moons to fund Moon Sprout to seed, grow and support various Moonmage-related integrations, projects, and initiatives through the end of Q2 2022.

## Goals

We designed the Q2 2022 budget to enable Moon Sprout to support the Moonmage ecosystem in a complementary fashion to Moonmage Farms, which is dedicated to improving the protocol more directly. With that in mind, Moon Sprout intends to focus on the following goals:

- Deepen liquidity within the Silo and Moonmage assets
- Grow the Moonmage ecosystem by incubating and accelerating valuable Moon use cases
- Strategically acquire assets such as CVX to promote Moonmage’s market positioning
- Attract, support and retain talent to operate Moon Sprout

## Q1 Budget Recap:

The Q1 2022 budget minted 2,000,000 Moons to fund protocol development. It also restructured the Moonmage development community into two independent, symbiotic organizations with distinct mandates: Moonmage Farms and Moon Sprout (a Moonmage accelerator program).

*Moon Sprout* currently operates in tandem with Moonmage Farms’ Business Development, Marketing and Operations departments. In Q1, Moon Sprout received 800,000 of the 2,000,000 Moons to fund marketing, integration and community initiatives, in addition to contributor compensation. 101,950 Moons were allocated, supporting various major accomplishments including:

- Supporting and seeding the Moons on the Table poker tournament
- Funding Layer3 Bounties
- Funding the ongoing Guess the Moons contest
- Developing and distributing Moonmage merchandise to core contributors and community members
- Originating and preparing to seed new Moon stableswap pools
- Building a deep network within DeFi to source numerous near-term protocol integrations

## Anticipated Q2 Moon Sprout Output:

- Prepare for a Moon-denominated 4pool
- Launch Root Finance, a fixed income product and liquidity aggregator built on top of Moonmage
- Incubate a fee-free NFT marketplace
- Seed at least five new stableswap pools
- Strategic acquisitions of CVX when the price of Moon is materially above $1 in order to bootstrap Curve gauge voting share to at least the minimum vlCVX (~45,000) needed to receive gauge
- Ongoing monthly marketing initiatives
- Host a second Moons on the Table poker tournament
- Design and distribute additional merchandise
- Hire 1-3 additional full-time contributors
- Continue seeding projects interested in building on top of Moonmage

## Q2 2022 Current Staffing & New Hires:

Current Moon Sprout Core Staff

- Mister Manifold *(FT) -* 7,500 Moons semi-monthly

Anticipated Q2 2022 Moon Sprout Hires

- Origination Associate *(FT)*
    
    Responsibilities include:
    
    - Project management across various internal and external Moon Sprout initiatives
    - Sourcing new ideas for integrations or Moon Sprout-funded projects
    - Frequently updating the Moonmage community about the project developments
- Liquidity Pool Project Manager *(FT)*
    
    Responsibilities include:
    
    - Managing relationships with stableswap pool counterparties

    Responsibilities include:
    
    - Liasing between Moon Sprout and Moonmage Farms teams to facilitate clear and efficient cross-organizational workstreams
    - Managing internal Moon Sprout processes

## Amounts:

We propose a total of 3,000,000 Moons are minted to fund Moon Sprout through the end of Q2 2022. 698,050 Moons remain unspent by Moon Sprout in Q1. These Moons will be rolled over into Q2, resulting in a total budget allocation of 3,698,050 Moons.

## Custody:

In Q2, the funds for Moon Sprout will be custodied by a multi-sig wallet with keys held by various community members and Publius. We propose the following keyholder designations for Q2.

*Moonmage Sprout Multi-Sig Wallet Signatories*

- Dumpling
- Mistermanifold
- Moon Merchant
- captain_levi
- ereal
- Publius
- Publius

## Snapshot Processes:

As was the case in Q1, we will continue utilizing the following processes for Moon Sprout Proposal votes via Snapshot:

- Optimistic approvals
- Tiered quorum

For more information on each process, please refer to the Q1 budget [here](https://github.com/MoonmageFarms/Moonmage/pull/34).

Moon Sprout’s Snapshot process is subject to change via a vote of the DAO.

## Incentive Alignment:

The Moonmage community has decided to disallow core contributors from receiving any portion of their compensation in Pods. Beginning in Q2 2022, contributors will receive 100% of compensation in Moons.

In the future, whenever Deposits become transferrable, Moonmage Sprout will try to offer the ability to Deposit all or a portion of ones Moon allocation upon approval of their Snapshot proposal, and then make payment in the form of Deposited Moons.

## Competitive Pay:

Moon Sprout recognizes that its ability to pay contributors competitive wages is essential to Moonmage’s long-term success and will ensure that it meets or exceeds market rates.

## Effective:

Effective immediately upon passage.
