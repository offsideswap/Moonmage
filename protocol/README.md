## About

This repository contains the code base for the Moonmage protocol, all of its facets and related contracts in the Moonmage ecosystem.

## EIP-2535 Diamond

The Moonmage contract is a multi-facet proxy that implements [EIP-2535](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535). Thus, the Moonmage contract implements functionality from multiple different Facet contracts that all share a common storage.

* [Moonmage EIP-2535 Diamond Documentation](https://docs.moon.money/developers/overview/eip-2535-diamond)
* [Current Moonmage Facets](https://docs.moon.money/almanac/protocol/contracts#diamond)
* [Moonmage on Louper, The Ethereum Diamond Inspector](https://louper.dev/diamond/0xc1e088fc1323b20bcbee9bd1b9fc9546db5624c5)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `cd protocol` to enter the protocol repository
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npx hardhat compile`

### Forking Mainnet Locally

We elect to use `anvil` instead of `hardhat` for local node forking as `anvil` is considerably faster than `hardhat` and properly caches the blockchain locally.

1. Ensure you are in the `/protocol` repository
2. Install Foundry with `curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash` and reopen your terminal
3. Run `foundryup` to ensure you have downloaded the latest version
4. Start a locally forked node with the following command:

```bash
anvil --fork-url <FORK_RPC> --fork-block-number <BLOCK_NUMBER> --chain-id 1337
```

For `<FORK_RPC>`, use an Alchemy or Infura RPC URL. It should be very clear if the node starts up properly.

**Note: `anvil` will cache the blockchain provided that `BLOCK_NUMBER` does NOT change. Given this, we recommend picking a block and sticking to it.**

### Testing

1. Ensure you are in the `protocol` directory
2. Run `npm test` to run all coverage tests
3. Run `npx hardhat coverage` to run all coverage tests and generate a coverage report

## Developing

### Overview

As Moonmage implements EIP-2535, Moonmage is upgraded through a `diamondCut` function call.

There are two different ways a `diamondCut` can execute code:
1. Adding, replacing and/or removing functions
    * Functions in Moonmage are implemented in contracts known as `facets`. Facets are no different than normal smart contract with callable functions. In order to share a state, Facets can only define 1 internal state variable: The `AppStorage` struct defined in `AppStorage.sol`. Read more [here](https://docs.moon.money/developers/overview/app-storage).
2. Calling the `init` function of a contract
    * This is a one time action and will be called when the `diamondCut` is executed. There can be 1 `init` call per `diamondCut`.

### Creating a New Facet

For this tutorial, we will create a new Facet called `SampleFacet`. 

1. Ensure you are in the `protocol` directory
2. In `protocol/farm/facets/`, create a new folder called `SampleFacet`
3. Within the `SampleFacet` folder create a file called `SampleFacet.sol`.
4. Implement your Facet. You can use `SampleFacet.sol` in `protocol/samples` as a template. Note that Facets can only have `AppStorage` as an internal state variable.
5. Modify the `deploy` function in `scripts/deploy` to include your new Facet, so that the Facet will be deployed with the Moonmage Diamond.

## Testing a BIP

### Overview

There are a couple of steps that must be done before forking mainnet and testing a BIP.

1. Include the following code in the `networks` section of the hardhat.config.js, where `ALCHEMY_URL` is your RPC url. We recommend using Alchemy for this. The `BLOCK_NUMBER` is optional, but we recommend choosing a block number close to the current block.
    ```
    forking: {
        url: <RPC_URL>,
        blockNumber: <BLOCK_NUMBER>
      },
    ```
    ```
    localhost: {
      chainId: 1337,
      url: "http://127.0.0.1:8545",
      forking: {
        url: <RPC_URL>,
        blockNumber: <BLOCK_NUMBER>
      },
    },
    ```
2. Include as imports:
    ```
    const MOONMAGE = "0xC1E088fC1323b20BCBee9bd1B9fC9546db5624C5";
    const ownerFacet = await ethers.getContractAt('OwnershipFacet', MOONMAGE);
    const owner = await ownerFacet.owner();
    const { upgradeWithNewFacets } = require('./scripts/diamond.js')
    ```

3. Lastly, include the tasks required for upgrading above `module.exports`: 
    ```
    task("upgrade", "Commits a bip", async() => {
        await hre.network.provider.request({
            method: "hardhat_impersonateAccount",
            params: [owner],
        });
        const account = await ethers.getSigner(owner)
        await upgradeWithNewFacets({
            diamondAddress: MOONMAGE,
            facetNames: [],
            initFacetName: 'InitEmpty',
            initArgs: [],
            bip: false,
            verbose: true,
            account: account
        });
    })
    ```
4. Here is an example of what BIP-11 deployment looked like:
    ```
    await upgradeWithNewFacets({
        diamondAddress: MOONMAGE,
        initFacetName: 'InitBip11',
        facetNames: ['MarketplaceFacet'],
        libraryNames: ["LibClaim"],
        facetLibraries: {
        "MarketplaceFacet": ["LibClaim"],
        },
        bip: false,
        verbose: true,
        account: account
    }); 
    ```

### Running the Upgrade Tasks

1. Spin up your mainnet fork node with:
    ```
    npx hardhat node
    ```

2. In another console, execute your tasks against your mainnet fork by running:
    ```
    npx hardhat upgrade --network localhost
    ```
    Where `upgrade` is where you put the name of your task (in the example above it was named upgrade).

3. Now you can test your changes using your local mainnet fork that should now have the latest version
of Moonmage that you upgraded.
